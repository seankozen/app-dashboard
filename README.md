# Project-7
Mobile first approach app dashboard utilizing chart.js
Uses local storage to save settings.
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based mockup images: [https://github.com/seankozen/app-dashboard/blob/main/dashboard.png]
## How to navigate this project
- After download, app can be accessed through the index.html file.
- Responsive CSS using Sass preprocessor: [https://github.com/seankozen/app-dashboard/tree/main/scss]
- Chart.js is used to create the graphs: [https://www.chartjs.org/]
## Why I built the project this way
- Sass includes a lot of flexibility and options when styling pages.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but for this project the focus was on the front end.
  Connecting to and actual app was not part of the project.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Recreate it using React.js.
